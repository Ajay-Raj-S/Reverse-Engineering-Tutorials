# Reverse-Engineering-Tutorials
Some Reverse Engineering Tutorials for Beginners interested in INFOSEC.

I group them by levels, I usually provide a compiled crack-me tool that you need to practice on and a tutorial.
The source code (in C) for the crack-me tool is always available in the level folder.

Tools you might need during this:
* Radare2: http://radare.org
* Python: https://www.python.org/
* Hopper Disassembler: https://www.hopperapp.com/

Programming knowledge is not required for the lower levels, but might help a lot as you proceed.
